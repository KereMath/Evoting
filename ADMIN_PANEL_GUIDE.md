## üê≥ **Docker Setup**

### Services

```yaml
1. postgres          (Port 5432)
2. main-server       (Port 8080) - Rust Backend
3. frontend          (Port 3000) - React App
```

### Starting Everything

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f main-server
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

### Access Points

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8080/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health

## üîê **Authentication**

### Hardcoded Credentials
```
Username: admin
Password: admin
Token: admin-token-12345 (static)
```

Token stored in localStorage, used for API requests.

## üìä **Database Schema**

### Tables Created

```sql
elections (
  id, name, description,
  threshold, total_trustees,
  status, created_at, started_at, ended_at
)

voters (
  id, election_id, voter_id (TC ID),
  did, status, created_at, voted_at
)

trustees (
  id, election_id, name,
  public_key, status, created_at
)

system_events (
  id, event_type, entity_type,
  entity_id, data (JSONB), created_at
)
```

## üîÑ **Data Flow**

### Creating an Election
1. Admin fills form (name, description, t, n)
2. POST `/api/elections`
3. Backend creates election in DB
4. Logs `election_created` event
5. Returns election with UUID
6. Frontend refreshes list

### Adding a Voter
1. Admin selects election
2. Enters TC Kimlik No (11 digits)
3. POST `/api/voters`
4. Backend validates and creates voter
5. Logs `voter_registered` event with data
6. Frontend shows in voters table

### Monitoring
1. Events endpoint polls every 2s
2. New events appear in real-time
3. Color-coded by type
4. Shows data flow (JSONB data field)
