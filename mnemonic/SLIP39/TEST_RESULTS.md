- ✅ 15/15 valid test vectors pass
- ✅ 30/30 invalid test vectors handled correctly
- ✅ 100% compatibility with Trezor's reference implementation

36. ✅ Threshold number of groups and members in each group (256 bits, case 1)
37. ✅ Threshold number of groups and members in each group (256 bits, case 2)
38. ✅ Threshold number of groups and members in each group (256 bits, case 3)
41. ✅ Valid mnemonics which can detect some errors in modular arithmetic
42. ✅ Valid extendable mnemonic without sharing (128 bits)
43. ✅ Extendable basic sharing 2-of-3 (128 bits)
44. ✅ Valid extendable mnemonic without sharing (256 bits)
45. ✅ Extendable basic sharing 2-of-3 (256 bits)

### Invalid Test Vectors (All Handled Correctly)

30 invalid test vectors covering:
- Invalid checksums
- Invalid padding
- Insufficient shares
- Mismatched identifiers
- Mismatched thresholds
- Duplicate indices
- Invalid digests
- Insufficient groups

All invalid vectors are correctly rejected during parsing or reconstruction.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core SLIP-39 Features
- ✅ Single-group secret sharing (N-of-M threshold schemes)
- ✅ Multi-group secret sharing with group thresholds
- ✅ Threshold=1 optimization (all shares identical)
- ✅ Threshold>1 with digest-based verification
- ✅ Both 128-bit and 256-bit master secrets
- ✅ Extendable flag support

### Cryptographic Components
- ✅ Shamir Secret Sharing over GF(256)
- ✅ LOG/EXP table-based GF(256) arithmetic (Trezor-compatible)
- ✅ Lagrange interpolation for reconstruction
- ✅ HMAC-SHA256 digest verification
- ✅ Feistel cipher with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- ✅ RS1024 checksum for error detection
- ✅ Left-padding for 10-bit word encoding

### Implementation Details
- 0-based x-coordinates for both members and groups (matching Trezor)
- Interpolation at x=255 (SECRET_INDEX) and x=254 (DIGEST_INDEX)
- Proper handling of x=0 coordinate
- Correct digest-based SSS for threshold>1 cases

## Test Execution

Run all tests:
```bash
cargo test --test official_vectors
```

Test only valid vectors:
```bash
cargo test --test official_vectors test_all_valid_vectors
```

Test only invalid vectors:
```bash
cargo test --test official_vectors test_all_invalid_vectors
```

## Compliance

This implementation is fully compliant with:
- SLIP-39 specification (https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md)
- Trezor's reference implementation (python-shamir-mnemonic)
- Official test vectors from Trezor repository

All 45 official test vectors pass without modifications.
